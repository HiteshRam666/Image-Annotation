# Image Annotation & Visualization 🐠

Welcome to the **Aquarium Dataset** project, where we explore, process, and visualize a fascinating aquarium-themed image dataset! Using COCO annotations, this project guides you through the steps of downloading, mapping, and displaying dataset images with bounding boxes around the objects 🖼️.

## 📂 Project Overview

In this project, we use the **Aquarium Dataset** from Kaggle and leverage COCO annotations to understand the dataset structure and visualize objects. The notebook:
1. **Downloads the dataset** using `opendatasets`.
2. **Loads and processes COCO-style annotations** with `pycocotools`.
3. **Displays images with bounding boxes** around objects for easy visualization and exploration.

> **Goal**: This project aims to demonstrate how to work with COCO-annotated image datasets for object detection or classification tasks, making it a great reference for beginners in computer vision!

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aquarium-dataset-visualization.git
cd aquarium-dataset-visualization
```

### 2. Install Requirements
The notebook installs packages like `opendatasets`, `matplotlib`, `Pillow`, and `pycocotools` directly, but for convenience:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Notebook
Launch Jupyter Notebook and run each cell to see the dataset in action!
```bash
jupyter notebook Untitled9.ipynb
```

## 🛠️ Key Components

- **Dataset Download**: Fetch the dataset from Kaggle.
- **COCO Annotation Loading**: Use JSON and `pycocotools` to load image and category metadata.
- **Image Mapping**: Map category and image IDs for easy access.
- **Visualization**: Custom functions display bounding boxes for a clear, structured view of the dataset.

## 📊 Example Visualizations

Here’s a sneak peek of what you’ll see:

1. **Mapped Categories** 🗂️
2. **Bounding Boxes on Images** 🎯

## 📚 Project Structure

- **notebooks/**: Contains the main Jupyter notebook.
- **data/**: Placeholder for the downloaded dataset.
- **requirements.txt**: List of necessary packages.

## ✨ Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Visualizations**: Add more details and color coding per category.
- **Model Training**: Use these annotations for object detection training on models like YOLO, Faster R-CNN, etc.
- **Data Augmentation**: Apply transformations to expand the dataset size.

## 💡 Usage & Applications

This project serves as a learning base for working with COCO datasets, making it ideal for:
- **Object Detection Projects**
- **Data Science Competitions**
- **COCO Annotation Practice**
